<p>
We have been working for a few months on our new educational project named <a href="http://e-duca.cc">E-Duca (Evolving Education)</a> and we can now share a little more details about it with you.
</p>
<p>
E-Duca is a research and development project approved and co-financed by QREN for 2 years. It consists of developing an integrated technological platform applied to education. The platform specification englobes components of hardware (computer projection system and mobile robots) and software (applications of educational and monitoring).
</p>
<p>
Technology is taking an important role in education, and requires the creation of solutions which explore new learning possibilities. We aim to develop and explore learning environments at three levels:<br/>
- Content learning development, with special attention to the characteristics of the students stimulating the process learning by doing;<br/>
- Diversifying different used technologies to create learning dynamics in an immersive and interactive environment with different multi sensorial stimulae;<br/>
- Integrating monitorization and evaluation tools that enable teachers and parents to measure the learning curve from students in certain applications and subjects.
 </p>
 <p>
Developed with open source software, E-Duca is designed to be adaptable to different spaces - classrooms, libraries and media rooms, auditoriums, etc... Being a modular system, it aims to give the possibility to any educator / teacher to insert their own content on the platform in a simple and intuitive way.
</p>
<p>
To help us put together and test this pilot platform, we have the support of our partners at <a href="http://www.cesarioverde-ensino.pt/">Cesário Verde</a> School, where we have been working since the beggining of this academic year with a group of 5th grade students and other steering groups, allowing us to test contents for all the years of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycles.
</p>
<p>
In these sessions with the students, we initially worked on basic concepts of programming and introduction to robotics, enabling them to develop skills such as logical thinking and abstraction - essential for learning mathematics and geometry. It also aimed to promote the technological autonomy of the students: to use the computer as a tool for solving problems creatively, make it an educational resource that can be applied in teaching practices in the various curriculum components to supplement the lessons.

<p>
In a second phase we are testing the interactive room with diversified content that explores the space, time, and communication, through group activities and learning games that exercise the motor and intellectual functions of the students, group dynamics, rules recognition, etc... These contents are intended to be complementary to the curriculum, aiding the learning processes by the ease with which information is captured by the students.

<p>
The team of Cesário Verde has had a key role the pedagogic and didactic approach, through the creation of a working group and follow-up monitoring of the sessions.
 </p>
 <p>
The development of such innovative solutions depends on their applicability in the real world. In the case of E-Duca, we are involved with Cesário Verde school, testing immediately all developments of the project at its most embryonic stage, ensuring its usefulness and applicability in a real setting. The team of Cesário Verde has a key role on the pedagogic and didactic approach of the platform, through the creation of a working group and follow-up monitoring of the sessions.

We are very pleased to annouce our most recent educational project: <a href="http://usora.cc/">USORA</a> (Unified Solution of Remote Access in Practical Vocational Engineering Education). A project of innovation transfer under the Leonardo Da Vinci Life Learning Programme.
</p>
<p>
We had the kick-off meeting at the end of last October. Present at this meeting were representatives from our project partners from Estonia, Germany and Portugal:
</p>
<p>
- <a href="http://www.ittgroup.ee/">ITT Group</a>, an estonian company whose main areas of activity are ICT development, consulting and custom mechatronic and robotics designs.<br/>
- <a href="http://it-matters.eu/">it:matters</a>, a german spin off founded in 2010, whose main focus of work is on internet technology. Development of Web 2.0 based content, IT consulting, IT development, Media, IT knowledge transfer / IT teaching, IT project management, programing and product development.<br/>
- <a href="http://www.vkhk.ee/">VKHK</a> (Võrumaa Kutsehariduskeskus), an estonian vocational training center focused on creating a contemporary study environment and a professional higher education study programme that includes IT Systems, Computers and Networks.<br/>
- <a href="http://www.hochschule-bochum.de/en/">HBO</a> (Hochuschule Bochum), german Bochum University of Applied Sciences who possess three centers of competence: Construction, Business and Engineering which include basic studies in electrical engineering, mechatronics and computer sciences. Their main research activities focus on the two master studies: Mechatronics and IT-Automotive and Internet Technologies.<br/>
- <a href="http://www.isr.ist.utl.pt">IST-ID</a> (Association of Instituto Superior Técnico for Research and Development), a portuguese non-for-profit institution, which primarily aims at carrying out science and technology activities, fostering knowledge transfer and promoting the involvement of national and foreign researchers, internally and externally, in research and development projects in their areas of expertise.<br/>
- <a href="http://www.inete.pt/">INETE</a> (Institute of Technical Education), a portuguese technical and vocational school dedicated to the initial qualification of young people and the continuous training of active professionals, promoting school education and vocational training for youngsters and adults.<br/>

<p>
The sectors of engineering and robotics are constantly faced with the need to integrate different technologies such as internet, electronics and software. Yet the design and development methods are still very new. There is an important need for education, especially in lifelong learning programs, many of the workers in these sectors are not yet prepared for these changes. The aim of the <a href="http://usora.cc">USORA</a> project is to contribute in raising the level of vocational education students and the continuous education of professional workers in the engineering domain, specially in ICT and robotics, by transferring to Portugal the technologies behind the innovative remote lab concept, namely the <a href="http://home.roboticlab.eu/">DistanceLab</a> and VirtualLab solutions developed in Estonia and Germany. Adapting it to the Portuguese needs and bringing it online.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://home.roboticlab.eu/">DistanceLab</a> system will also be integrated with <a href="http://magabot.cc/">Magabot</a>, a novel robotic platform developed in Portugal. The integration of this new device adds multi-transfer dimension to the project and increases the quality of the existing system in Estonia and Germany. 
</p>
<p>
Several studies in Europe point out that the engineering fields are not the first choice of young people, however the engineering skills and robotic field itself are one of the key knowledge of European economy growth in a long perspective. Project <a href="http://usora.cc">USORA</a> focuses on the fact that there is a lack of skilled worker force in ICT and robotic sector due to its rapid growth. There is growing gap between the industry need and available skilled workforce, especially due to the rise of Asian manufacturers and engineers and competition with Europe.
</p>
<p>
The aim of the <a href="http://usora.cc">USORA</a> project for its 2 years of development is to carry out the following activities:
</p>
<p>
- Perform a deep analysis of the current industrial and educational situation, study methods and student behavior in the target sector.<br/>
- Adapting the DistanceLab and VirtualLab systems according to the acquired knowledge.<br/>
- Establishing the Remote Lab prototype system in Portugal.<br/>
- Integrating the robotic platform developed in Portugal with a new e-environment.<br/>
- Piloting the solution in Portugal, Germany and Estonia.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The partnership has strong competence in the main project fields. Theoretical and practical aspects of system design are the main strength of the Estonian and Portuguese partners. The ICT and embedded system experience and tight connections with the industry is the focus of our German partners.
</p>
<p>
We hope that in the long term this project will contribute in increasing the competence of new and practicing engineers and contemporary learning tools.
