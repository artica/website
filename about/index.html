				<p>"Trabalhamos com a Artica no <a href="http://artica.cc/blog/2013/07/15/ciav-tech-report.html">Centro de Interpretação de Almada Velha</a> em que desenvolveram, produziram e instalaram a componente audiovisual, cenográfica e aplicação interativa estruturantes para este novo equipamento municipal. Mais do que uma eficaz relação contratual, com manifesta competência e profissionalismo técnico exigidos, nomeadamente  antecipando limitações e preocupações a posteriori de manutenção e gestão dos dispositivos por parte do cliente, encontramos um parceiro com uma enorme capacidade de interação e mobilização criativa no domínio do design, cenografia, criação de ambientes sonoros capazes de despertar emoções, passar informação, desafiar à descoberta do território. Um processo em que se conjugou o conhecimento científico/técnico para soluções contemporâneas, com o saber do artesão que constrói fazendo. Uma cumplicidade que gostaríamos de prosseguir futuramente."</p>
