Motoruino most important features:

- easy to use, understand, play with
- plug-and-roll board
- compatible with Arduino Diecimilla/Duemillanove and Shields
- one H-Bridge (L293D) allows you to control 2 dc motors
- the usage of the H-Bridge is open, i.e., there arenâ€™t any Arduino output pins assigned, the user can use the H-Bridge the way he/she wants
- two jumpers allow the motors power supply and the PWM pins to be either connected to the external supply (Vin) or regulated 5 volts
- motors have 3 different connectors, screw terminals, male headers, JST connectors
- servos and sensors can be easily plugged in due to dedicated power and ground headers on each pin
- two possible FTDI/USB connections available:USB / TTL convertor, there are some choices on the market for this one, you can have it in the form of a cable, or in the form of a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716">small pcb</a> or using a <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/FTProducts.htm">USB adaptor with the FTDI chip embedded</a>

In case you are interested in purchasing one, please drop us an <a href="http://artica.cc/contacts/"> email </a>	


All other specifications are similar to the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDiecimila#.UymNEa1_sUc">Arduino Diecimila</a> boards, and you may use both ATmega 168 or 328 chips
