MusicBox is the new PT's music channel, at the festival they wanted to had the application on a big screen and have the possibility to control it using hand gesture. We were hired by <a href="http://hipnose.com">Hipnose</a> to accomplish the challenge.

This was ment to be with the so known kinect camera, but what they didn't know is that the kinect doesn't work outdoor, so we used a laser sensor and it worked flawlessly!!

This installation had a huge PA (power amplifier - sound system) outside, and when there was a concert at the main stage we need to cut the sound so we also customize four headphones to let the people still listen to the grooves. <a href="http://margaridantunes.weebly.com/">Margarida and Fernando</a> did a great job with the headphones!!

We also added a led strip, it was ment to give instant feedback to the user, when a hand was detected it changed color to green, on click it gives red and on idle went blue.
