<a href="http://artica.cc">Artica</a> was invited by the very popular theater company <a href="http://www.obando.pt/">Teatro O Bando</a>, to create visual scenes to the performance "Pedro e Inês".

It's a play about a forbidden love during the Portuguese monarchy in the 14th century, and to better portray certain scenes during the performance we were asked to create peculiar visual stuff: fire, deers, rain and other realms to transport the viewer to the peace..it was a "wow" experience! What else could we ask for!?

One of the big challenge's was the screen, wich wasn't the conventional white screen, it was a translucent screen,  a grid, and due to its reflective nature it turns out to be spectacular for our projections.

Once again we used our "Einstein Video Player" (the same we used in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwja_nB1PI0&amp;feature=player_embedded">Paint Me</a>) with a couple of enhancements and optimizations:
Performance;
Keystone and VideoPlane manipulation;
Control the application via TouchOSC.

We will talk more about this very soon for sure!!
