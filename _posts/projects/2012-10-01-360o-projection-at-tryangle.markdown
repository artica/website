<a href="http://tryangle.eu/">TryAngle</a> is a great artistic iniciative sponsored by the European Culture Programme, it had three labs, and one of the labs was at the "O Espaço do Tempo" in Montemor-o-Novo.

Two artists had this great idea of a video projection inside a cylinder, with a 360º panoramic view of "Praça de Touros de Montemor" filled with persons, where each person represented a degree. Guess who they called to stich the 18 photos, and set all the projection system inside an empty cylinder.. ? :)

This was a huge challenge for us since we had never tried such a thing and a huge challenge for our Einstein VideoPlayer. Glad that we made it and everyone was happy!!
