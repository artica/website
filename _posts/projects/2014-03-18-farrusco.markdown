Farrusco is a small robot based on the Arduino platform, in this case it’s using a Motoruino wich is an Arduino clone with a couple of enhancements – dc motor dual controller, servo and sensor plugs, possibility to select 5V or external power source for motors and PWM pins.

With Farrusco you will be able to make it avoid obstacles, follow walls, enter in free space mode, and in the future more add-ons will be available, just to name a few: line follower, speakers and light sensors, RGB leds, and so on.

In addition to Motoruino, you can add the SandBox shield to the robot to extend its functionality.
This Arduino Shield is great for students and hobbyists that want to start playing with electronics and programming on the Arduino platform. 
It comes with plenty of analog and digital devices giving a great creative potential to users: 

- 1 potentiometer 
- 2 buttons 
- 1 RGB Led 
- 2 colored LEDs 
- 1 InfraRed Receiver 
- 1 buzzer 
-2 LDRs

Every component can be connected using a pitch jumper or a jumper wire, which gives full control of every single connection.


<strong>Assembly Instructions:</strong>

Farrusco is easy to assemble, all you have to do is follow the step-by-step instructions shown on the next video.

<strong>Introduction to Robotics Workshop with Farrusco:</strong>

Artica has been lecturing workshops related to Introduction to Robotics all over the country. 

The Workshops are designed to initiate young people and adults in the world of physical computing, electronics, and programming.

During the workshop the participants have to "give life" to the robot Farrusco, assigning it different behaviors such as navigating space avoiding obstacles, following walls, chasing light sources and defining states of humor through colored LEDs and loudspeakers.
