Artica has been lecturing workshops related to Introduction to Robotics all over the country. This particular workshop is intended to teach basic physical computing programming oriented to robotics, and is all <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> oriented.

It is very common that participants never wrote a single line of code, so they are taught to read digital and analog sensor data, basic servo motor and dc motor control. The workshop climax is when the participant is able to make the robot roam around a space and void obstacles, visualize behaviour feedback with colored RGB LEDs, drive the robot using LDR sensors, follow walls, follow lines, and so on. Basically, it is a day full of action and fun.
