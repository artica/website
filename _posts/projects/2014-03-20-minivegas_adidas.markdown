Dutch agency MINIVEGAS asked Artica to create an interactive hardware component

for the Champions League football competition in Munich. It included buttons, 

movement sensors and electromagnetic sensors that enabled fans of the two 

competing Ô¨Ånalist teams to send votes. The voting results were displayed 

real time in a large scale projection.
