I SEE YOU TOO, is the 2nd version of the original <a href="http://lab.guilhermemartins.net/2010/07/20/icu/">ICU</a>

<img class="postimage" src="/assets/images/2011-11-18-icu2-2.jpg"/>

This version gained an upgrade in both hardware and software.

The hardware is mostly based on <a href="http://servocity.com">servocity.com</a> pan and tilt systems.

This is a work in progress, until now what is implemented is Face Detect with the openCV library for Processing.
Next stage is to implement a more robust face and emotions detection and this will run on top of an inverse kinematics algorithm. What we want the most is ICU2 to be a living organism, with a complex behavior tree system.
