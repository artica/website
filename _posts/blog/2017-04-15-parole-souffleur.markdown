You might remember one year ago we wrote [a blog post about auto-theater][1]. Our talks with Alexandre Pieroni Calado of [Artes e Engenhos][5] evolved into a piece titled [Kaspar: Palavra Soprada][2] or "Parole Soufflée". Artica played a technical role on the production of this play, developing custom-made interactive technology. The piece uses a custom version of our [Einstein VideoPlayer][3].

Parole Soufflée is a cross disciplinary project that promotes the Prompters role within the theatre practice, while discussing it as an image of the role of language in the formation of the subject. The project was led by a research conducted with the prompters working today at the D. Maria II National Theatre (Lisbon). As a result we present the auto-theatre piece Kaspar: Palavra Soprada.

This auto-theater piece places you in the role of the theater prompter, watching the play through a monitor, handling a joystick to pan, tilt and zoom around the different parts of the stage. The viewer is invited to wear headphones to listen in on what's being said on the play. As it progresses there are several moments of interaction where choices can be made using speech recognition and button presses. Lights and motors are also triggered during the play creating a more immersive environment with the scenographic physical elements.

The play was on preview at our installations for a few weeks and now had it's [opening on the 1st of April at Latoaria][4] in Lisbon.

You can find more information of where the play will be toured at [Artes e Engenhos website][5].

While developing the different modules of the system we recorded a few videologs of the process which we would like to share with you.

Here Filipe shows the results of our Speech Recognition API research:
