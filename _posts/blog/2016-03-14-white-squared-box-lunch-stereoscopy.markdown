We have a tradition at Artica of reserving Friday lunches as a team activity where we balance what we been doing this week and what needs to get tackled next week. To make sure everyone is present we originally called it a "brown bag lunch" session. Where people are supposed to bring their lunches from home in a brown bag, sit around a table and eat it while others talk. But since most of us don't bring lunch from home in a brown bag we ended up ordering pizzas every week. So the session ended up renamed into what is known today as the "white squared box". Sometimes we use these sessions to present to the company topics that are core to some of our services. And we thought it might be cool for our followers out there to read about it aswell.

This week Andr√© talked to us a bit about [stereoscopy][1] and stereo vision. Stereoscopy is a technique used to create a depth illusion with images, which produces a "3D effect". This is an example of a primitive use of this technique, we have two images, both taken at a slight different distance. Once we join the two, overlapping one another we will see a 3D effect.

The same happens in reality every time we watch something with both our eyes, having two different perspective views of the same object helps our brain recognize the depth position of a tridimensional object. The stereo vision allows us to have a depth perception, to analyze if something is far or close to us.

There are many ways to reconstruct 3D using stereoscopy, using [anaglyphic][3] glasses, polarized glasses, and more recently virtual reality helmets, or it's lowcost cousin the [google cardboard][2].

This technique later evolved to the virtual reality technologies we have so far, being used mostly in 3D Film Making and Virtual Reality Game Development. There are real stereoscopic cameras in the market, with 2 cameras mounted with small separation, capturing two feeds (expensive like hell to buy or rent). And there is software to recreate two views based off a monoscopic capture (whose quality usually sucks compared to the real capture).

Another usage that we make of stereoscopy in our projects can be found on the wii controllers, where the emitter is placed near the projection surface and the controllers can recognize depth based from the distance between both extreme points of the emitter.
