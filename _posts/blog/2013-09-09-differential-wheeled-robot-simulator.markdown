This <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> application is meant to simulate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_wheeled_robot">differential wheeled robot</a>, very used nowadays. This app will be usefull in our <a href="http://guibot.pt">Robotics Workshops</a>!

<del datetime="2013-09-30T22:42:36+00:00">I missed the github class so here it is the good'old zip</del>
<a href="https://github.com/Artica/DifferentialDriveSimulator-Processing">Here's the link to the repo</a>, you're welcome to contribute  ;)

There are still a couple of enhancements on the list:
<ul>
        <li>real metrics and scale</li>
	<li>connect to motor encoders</li>
        <li>record a path on the virtual world and let the real robot follow it</li>
	<li>become real simulator of the arduino code used in our robotics workshops</li>
</ul>

The video is reproduced a lot faster than the program really performs Â :p

Some control keys are available:

The overall program is quite simple to use, just pass the mouse over the joystick area to control the bot.

The program basically maps joystick values X and Y to a differential drive system where two motors are used to drive a robot.  

There is also a representation of a robot and its path according to the motors differential rotation.
