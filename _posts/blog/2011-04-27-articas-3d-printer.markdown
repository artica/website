As you noticed, we've not blogged that frequently and now you'll understand why...

Our new 3D printer just arrived and we're very happy with the new toy! We don't have to say that you're all invited to show up and try the printer.

To open your appetite we'll show you some photos and a video of the very first prototype, a duckotype!

We're going to rent the machine, so if you need to print something do not hesitate and contact us: 212947828 (Artica Headquarters), 912227682 (Andr√©) or 918154947 (Guilherme).

We have different materials and colors, so you can choose which one's the best for your project.
