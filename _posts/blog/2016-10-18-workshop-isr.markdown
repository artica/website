During the last week of July we gave a robotics workshop at [Institute for Systems and Robotics][1]'s [LARSyS lab][4] using our latest robotic platform [Gyro][2].

The workshop was given under the [Ciência Viva no Laboratório][3] program. We gave the attendees an introduction to programming and introduction to robotics. There was also some soldering involved, to customize a sandbox PCB as an add-on board for Gyro.

This workshop enabled the students to program the robots to participate in search and rescue scenarios featuring line following algorythms, color detection and ramp climbing.
