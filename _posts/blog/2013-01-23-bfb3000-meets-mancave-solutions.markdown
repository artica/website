<a href="http://wiki.bitsfrombytes.com/images/6/63/Abs_warp.jpg">ABS warping</a> and PLA broken filaments is a very well known issue in the 3d print world! At Artica we have our good old BFB3000 and we solved this problems using what we have later proudly called "mancave solutions"!!  :D

Here we are using a heater pointed to the printer, this keeps the object and the platform quite warmy! and it works flawleslly! Besides it keeps the room quite warm wich feels good under the winter... Summer will be much hotter we suppose!!

PLA filament lose elastic properties through the time and on the BFB3000 it simply snaps inside the rubber tubes... We created a roof on the top of the printer as you can see, the filament enters the print head without any stress and no more snaps!
