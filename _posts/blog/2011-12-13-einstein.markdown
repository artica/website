We're very pleased to announce the launch of our new open source video player!

Einstein VideoPlayer is a project initiated by <a href="http://lab.guilhermemartins.net/">Guilherme Martins</a> during a dance performance entitled <a href="http://en.opera.se/forestallningar/einstein-and-the-guest-house-2010-2011/">“Einstein Dreams”</a> created by <a href="http://www.oespacodotempo.pt/pt/esp_tem.php?idpan=rui">Rui Horta</a>. All this took place at <a href="http://en.opera.se/">Göteborg Opera</a> in Sweden, September of 2010.

Einstein is not just a tool to play videos, it allows anyone to play a list of videos, cross fading between them, with the possibility to adjust the video output to many kinds of surfaces.

“Content is king”, we believe that this tool is an ice breaker to anyone that intends to playback videos in thousands of different manners.

This is the first public release, however this will always be a work in progress project, and being open source we intend that you use, modify, hack and share this tool.
