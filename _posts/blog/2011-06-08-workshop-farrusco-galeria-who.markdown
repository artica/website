On June 3rd we got an amazing 4h hours of lecturing <a href="http://www.guibot.pt/workshop-robotica-criativa/?lang=pt-pt">"how to program" Farrusco </a>at the <a href="http://www.who.pt/galeria/">WHO galery</a>, where André Sier exhibited 64-bit.

It was a nice and rainy afternoon with bairro alto as background, perfect for a workshop.
The feedback was very good and we liked a lot to work with the 6 participants.

Take a look at the video:
