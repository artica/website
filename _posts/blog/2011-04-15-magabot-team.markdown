Today, we proudly present you the Magabot team, and it's third place on the contest <a href="http://robotica2011.ist.utl.pt/">Robótica - Festival Nacional de Robótica </a><em><a href="http://robotica2011.ist.utl.pt/">(Robotics - Robotics National Festival)</a> </em>an initiative of <a href="http://www.spr.ua.pt/site/">Sociedade Portuguesa de Robótica </a><em><a href="http://www.spr.ua.pt/site/">(Robotics Portuguese Society)</a>.</em>

The team lider <a href="http://www.franciscodias.net/">Francisco Dias</a> was developing <a href="http://www.franciscodias.net/robots/the-box">thebox</a> when we invited him to participate in this contest with our robotic plataform, developed together with <a href="http://www.idmind.pt">IdMind</a> and <a href="http://www.mapadasideias.pt">Mapa das Ideias</a>, Francisco invited his friend Francisco Purdom to join the team. 
Meanwhile we helped Francisco to know better the platforms and SDK's that he could use in the contest, and he started to port and integrating his <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> applications to <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameworks</a>, that's the base of Francisco's project to  <a href="hhttps://sites.google.com/site/laptoponwheels/">google science fair </a>.

The event occurred in <a href="http://www.ist.utl.pt/">Instituto Superior Técnico</a> between 6 and April 10th.

Magabot was on the category of <a href="http://robotica2011.ist.utl.pt/pt/competicoes/conducao_autonoma/">Autonomous Driving</a>, as a rookie, and got to the podium with a 3rd place.

The challenge was to make the robot drive a road, in a very similar way to an automobile, respecting the roads and the lines. The fastest robot wins the contest.

Magabot had an very positive performance, as you can check on the video below.

It was a great time. We felt that this participation was epic. The specific code for the contest was done in just 3 or 4 days. We helped the team to participate in both contests.
