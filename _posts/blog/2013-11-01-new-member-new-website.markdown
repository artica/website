excerpt: "We been busy here at Artica doing all sorts of things, including the kick off of two important 2 year projects which you'll hear more about in following posts. Meanwhile we recruited a new member to our team, Celso Martinho, also known as the CTO of Sapo. We know he is a very busy person, but while he's sleeping he'll always have time to share our dreams for the company. His first duty on the job was remodelling the company website to use github pages, Jekyll and InK."
