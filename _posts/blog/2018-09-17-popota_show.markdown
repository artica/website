In 2017 we were invited by [UAU][2] to participate in Popota's Christmas Show, that took place in [Campo Pequeno][7], Lisbon. 

It was a big challenge due to the requirements of the performance:
- Ultra-Large LED Wall
- 40 minutes of continuous video
- Videos triggered in sync with the actors/performers
- Real-time interactive contents

Plus, we also created all the visual contents and props. 

The visuals were created in Unity 3D, video post-editing and real-time graphics generation.

We also wanted to have a glimpse of the size of the screens and the stage, so we developed a VR stage.

Our [Einstein VideoPlayer][1] had to be updated to run large video dimensions with high performance, we used [HAP codec][3], this allowed us to use multi-layered contents with alpha transparency videos. EinsteinVP also received real-time video from a computer vision server running [Bonsai][4] linked to Unity, connected to a [Spout][6]server, if you are a MAC user, [Syphon][5] does the same job. 

This is an image of the two control computers, the left screen is showing an infra-red camera image being analysed in Bonsai, the right screen is our EinsteinVP.

We also created the props, this included a big school rubber, pencils, compass, pencil sharpener and a gramophone.
