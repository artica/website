"Júlio de Matos" is a comedy performed by Joaquim Monchique. The set has a non-conventional projection zone, and I had to adapt all the contents to it. I invited David Rebordão to help me with video capture and editing. David is a promising Movie Director and Producer, check out what it is the most watched portuguese film ever made: <a href="http://acurva.net">A Curva</a>.

The video below is just a sneak peak of what you might expect if you dare to watch the show.
