Our 3D printer is the best ally for this new (and still very secret) project!

We needed supports for two speakers, led boxes and wind tunnels.

Take a look ate the result:

The speakers with the two supports.

And finally the support for the motor:

All the pieces we're designed by our good friend Eric Costa.

Don't forget, you can print your own prototypes here at Artica.
