This is a first experiment on building a 3D printed robotic claw, I first got inspired by <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18339">this</a> project but it was designed for a micro servo, and I wanted to use a standard size servo so I had to design the claw from scratch.

The actual design still need one tweak or two to be optimized for 3D printing, but as it is now is fully functional.
