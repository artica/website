We were asked by [State of the Art][1] to create three interactive screens for the art exhibition “La Divina Comédia” that consisted of aquarelle paintings of Salvador Dalí.

Easy task for our [Einstein VideoPlayer][2]. To make sure the videos would match Einstein requirements we accompanied the filming process with the actors and company responsible for the capture. We programmed Einstein to play an initial video, and when someone would approach the screen a second video would be played.

A couple of challenges followed, like the place where the IR sensor would be placed, it should be seemlessly integrated into the architecture. So we first printed a model of a case to enclosure an Arduino and an IR sensor, then we created a silicon mold of the case and produced three samples. After some sanding, polish and painting, these cases got a great look.
