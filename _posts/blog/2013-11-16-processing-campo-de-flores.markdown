We have been giving a workshop at Colégio Campo de Flores, Caparica. Using the Processing framework to teaching graphics programming basics to students attending 12th grade.

We been getting some great results from the students. To give you an example, some of them already managed to get their own version of pong up and running after just 2 classes and having no prior programming knowledge! We are very proud of them and look forward to seeing their final works at the end of the month.

The teachers from Campo de Flores also wrote <a href="http://campodeflores.com/blog/2013/11/05/inovar-com-processing/">a post on their news blog</a> (in Portuguese) about the workshop.
