We were invited by the artist performer <a href="http://isabelcvalverde.blogspot.com/">Isabel Valverde</a>, who has particular interest in acting in the digital world, to create and develop a set of sensors for her avatar.

Not only she controls the avatar, but the virtual environment gives a feedback too through a vibratory motor placed in the artist chest, with the rest of  the sensors.

During all the process we used:
<ul>
	<li>one heart rate polar and one receptor ic2- to measure the heart beat and send the information to the arduino</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>one piezzo - attached to the belt of the heart rate allows us to measure the deep breath in and out of the dancer</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>one accelerometer of three axes - to detect hard movements</li>
</ul>

Later on we tested, but it's not available in this first prototype, a sensor to measure temperature and humidity. To visualize all data we created an sketch in processing.

For now Isabel Valverde and Todd Cochrane are working on the interface between this device and the virtual world.
