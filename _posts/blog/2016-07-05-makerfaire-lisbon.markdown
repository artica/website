This year Maker Faire Lisbon took place on the 25th and 26th of June. We focused our participating on showcasing a pinball machine hack that we did in partnership with [The Arcade Man][2], originally developed for a project by [Lobo Mau][3], we repurposed the pinball to show some video content by Artica. We are hoping to write a more in-depth article about the project in the near future, for now let's just summarize that the pinball was altered to display different sets of videos, triggered by the in-game pinball activity.

We also showed the latest progress of our edutainment platform [Gyro][4].

As usual at these events we saw a lot of interesting projects and was great to meet some of our maker friends again! Thank you to the organizing team for making it possible.
