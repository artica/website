[Oskar & Gaspar][1] is producing a Multimedia Show at Terreiro do Paço promoted by Turismo de Lisboa and EGEAC.

They are mapping video on the entire facade, and will have DJ's and VJ's playing many sessions every night from the 7th to the 16th of August. Artica gave them a hand to bring more interactivity with the audience through a little game between the sessions. 

We used the technology of our Pong game, used before in other events. We used the SDK that we developed for our partner [Audience Entertainment][2]. Using cameras and color, we are able to track interaction in large audiences.

Artica also helped with [the live stream during the last 3 days of the event][3].

We have been trying to collaborate with Oskar & Gaspar on a project for a long time and we were very proud of finally working with them on such an interesting project. This is also the first time the Audience Entertainment technology has been used in Portugal, since they are primarily based on the United States cinema market.
