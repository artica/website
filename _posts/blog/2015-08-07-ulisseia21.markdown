[Oskar & Gaspar][1] is producing a Multimedia Show at Terreiro do Paço promoted by Turismo de Lisboa and EGEAC.

They are video mapping the entire façade and will have dj's and vj's playing multiple sessions every night from the 7th to the 16th of August. They asked Artica to give them a hand to bring in some more interactivity with the audience with a little game between their sessions. So we are adapting technology of our audience pong game previsouly used in other events with color tracking and adapted it to use the SDK we have been developing for our great partner [Audience Entertainment][2], camera based motion interaction for large audiences.

We been trying to develop a partnership project with Oskar & Gaspar for a long time and we are very proud of finally being able to work with them on such an interesting project. This is also the first time Audience Entertainment technology has been used in Portugal, they primarily based on the United States cinema market.
