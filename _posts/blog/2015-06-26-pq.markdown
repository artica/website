[Prague Quadriennal of Perfomance Design and Spaces 2015][1]
> PQ is vibrant exhibition bristling with art and unusual experiences

We were invited by [APCEN][2] (Associação Portuguesa de Cenografia) to develop a fixed installation that would map a video to a room inside the PQ building in Prague. It doesn't like much, but there was an epic journey behind all this.

An identical room was created in Montemor-o-Novo and artists were invited to perform inside that replica. Their perfomances were shot with four video cameras and an overall video was created. The final video was then mapped through our [Einstein VideoPlayer][3] inside the original room in Prague.

Many different and interesting performances were created and captured during those 15 days (and nights).

The video installation was then assembled, calibrated and mapped in Prague.

The final result was a place where people could walk in, seat and experience the performances.
