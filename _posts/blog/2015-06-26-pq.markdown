"PQ is vibrant exhibition bristling with art and unusual experiences"

We where invited by [APCEN][2] “Associação Portuguesa de Cenografia” to develop a fixed installation that would map a video to a room inside the PQ building in Prague. This seems not much, but there was an epic work behind all of this.

An identical room was created in Montemor-o-Novo and artists were invited to perform inside this replica. Their perfomances were capture with four video cameras and an overall video was than created. This final video was than mapped with our [Einstein VideoPlayer][3] inside the original room in Prague.

Many different and interesting performances were created and captured during 15 days (and nights).

In Prague the video installation was assembled, calibrated and mapped.

The final product was a place where people could walk, seat and wonder the captured performances.
