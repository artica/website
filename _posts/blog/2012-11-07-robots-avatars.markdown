We had the opportunity to participate at the <a href="http://www.robotsandavatars.net/2012/09/robots-and-avatars-is-going-to-kibla-slovenia/">Robots &amp; Avatars</a> exhibition that took place in <a href="http://www.kibla.org">Kibla</a>, a multidisciplinary center. It was almost a 24 hours trip, but we finally get there.

The Robots &amp; Avatars exhibition is a great initiative create by the people at <a href="http://www.bodydataspace.net/">Body&gt;Data&gt;Space</a>, they are very into robotics, human-machine-interaction, telepresence and virtual worlds, take a time to visit their website.

We took with us three magabots, one of them was running NAVI (a cool project that I will speak on a later post). The other two were running telepresence with Skype, plenty of people had the opportunity to remotely visit the exhibiton.

This kid was controlling Magabot with an Android phone running Skype.

The exhibition had great robotic installations, debates, workshops and even artistic performances, I will leave you with some photos, apologize not having pictures of every installation.
