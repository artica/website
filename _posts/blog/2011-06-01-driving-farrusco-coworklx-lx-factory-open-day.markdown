excerpt: "Driving Farrusco came from a Guilherme\'s ideia called SWARS (see what a robot sees), since that time we all knew that this idea could go A LOT further, but having Farrusco on a remote terrace, where you could only have access by climbing an outside ladder... We confess, such idea never cross our minds, until... Our friend Fernando Mendes (Cowork_LX mentor) came to us with this crazy idea!"

Driving Farrusco came from a Guilherme's ideia called <a href="http://lab.guilhermemartins.net/2010/04/11/swars/">SWARS</a> (see what a robot sees), since that time we all knew that this idea could go A LOT further, but having Farrusco on a remote terrace, where you could only have access by climbing an outside ladder... We confess, such idea never cross our minds, until... Our friend <a href="http://www.coworklisboa.pt/">Fernando Mendes (Cowork_LX mentor)</a> came to us with this crazy idea!

We loved the challenge, and wanted since the first moment to create a cool and easy to use physical interface and it came out a nice piece:

Then Farrusco with the wireless cam already built in and two packs of batteries to enhance the play time (one battery pack is missing in this photo)
