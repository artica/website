This weekend (12 March 2016) we were at [Coderdojo LX][1] giving a robotics workshop using our robots [Farrusco][2], [Gyro][3] and [Gyro Creator tool][4] (previously known as Visualino). The workshop was given by Andr√© and Guilherme, teaching kids from ages 9 to 17 how to program different robot behaviors.
