Artica is 5 years old!

![](/assets/images/2016-01-27-5-years.jpg)

It feels like yesterday that the dream of Andr√© and Guilherme to form their own company started in 2011 in the garage of a friend.

A lot of things have happened since then: We attended a lot of meetings. Wrote a lot of proposals. Dealt with burocracy and non paying clients. Developed a lot of technology. Open sourced a lot of our software and hardware. Gave workshops. Designed solutions. Built robots. Wrote code. Attended events. Hosted visiting partners. Met interesting people of all ages and nationalities.

We are proud of all we have achieved so far! Building interactive museums, providing educational technology tools, researching technology for international partners, etc.

We are no longer 2 friends in a small garage, our space increased and our team has grown. Now we are close to a dozen hardworking souls keeping the Artica dream alive. We have been recently evaluated as small medium company excellency growth. Considered one of the most promising technology startups in Portugal.

But our work is not done yet. We look forward to keep building the best we can possibly build for our partners and clients. Hope to achieve our best activity year to date in 2016!
