Today we had a visit of a class from <a href="http://campodeflores.com/">Campo de Flores</a> school, we discussed our projects and talked about our robots, 3d printers and prototyping processes. Campo de Flores and Artica established a partnership long time ago, started with <a href="http://artica.cc/blog/2013/05/23/farrusco-colegio-campo-de-flores.html">demonstrations of our educational robotics kit Farrusco to the first grade classes</a>, then we lectured a <a href="http://artica.cc/blog/2013/11/16/processing-campo-de-flores.html">Processing workshop</a> to the secondary grade, and hopefully more workshops will happen.
