We had the honor to be invited for this great event and to do a short presentation of Artica's work. Creative Hubs are the next big thing in what concerns to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_industries">Creative Industries</a> empowerment, and we are very pleased to be known as a reference inside this sector.

After the presentation we had a good time talking with the <a href="http://www.constroisons.com/">ConstroiSons</a>, <a href="www.buinho.com">Buinho</a> and <a href="www.trienaldelisboa.com">Trienal de Arquitectura</a> krews. 

Big thanks to the <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.pt/">British Council</a> and <a href="http://addict.pt/">Addict</a> for the oppostunity to show our work!!
