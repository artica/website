We had the honor of being invited to this great event and do a short presentation of Artica's work. Creative Hubs are the next big thing in the [Creative Industries][1] empowerment, and we are very pleased to be recognized as a reference in the field.

After the presentation, we had a good time talking to the [ConstroiSons][2], [Buinho][3] and [Trienal de Arquitectura][4] crews. 

Big thanks to the [British Council][5] and [Addict][6] for the opportunity to show our work!
