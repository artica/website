We sent Farrusco to <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/user/5293">Andrew Terranova a.k.a. Ignoblegnome</a>. He will be representing <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/">Let's Make Robots</a> with a stand in the fair and we're very honored to be part of this great community. So if you are nearby don't forget to say "hi" to LMR bench, there will be plenty of cool robots there!
