We had the privilege to contribute to another great play doing all the light system this time with <a href="http://teatroabcpi.blogspot.com/">Teatro ABC.PI</a>.

"E algo acontece" is a work in progress, studies to another show called "Névoa".

The play is based in "Novos contos de montanha" by the Portuguese master <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Torga">Miguel Torga</a>.
