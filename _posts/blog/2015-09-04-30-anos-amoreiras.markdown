Amoreiras was the first big shopping center in Lisbon, that was born 30 years ago, a complete pioneer project. After 30 years of existence this center still flourishes!

We were asked by State of the Art to create three experiences. An interactive video wall, a corridor that could show Amoreiras Timeline while the visitors walk by and at last, the great attraction of the exhibition, an elevator interior that brings visitors to the last store, where they can have a full 360 degrees view of Lisbon. Amoreiras is known by the highest point in Lisbon.

In the floor interaction and wall interaction solutions we faced many hostile light situations and because of this fact we needed to change the detection algorithm. But we managed to get it working and stable in the end.

The elevator journey was the most troublesome to develop, we had to do all the hardware, software and content.

We built a fake elevator shaft, with LCD screens all around it. Place to store the machine with proper ventilation, connect all custom lighting electronics, buttons and LCD's together. We used [Einstein videoplayer][3] to play back the 360 degreee video of a trip to the top of Amoreiras on the multiple screens. To capture the footage we rented a drone to fly up with multiple gopro's attached on a custom gimble.
