Amoreiras was the first big shopping center in Lisbon, that was born 30 years ago, a complete pioneer project. After 30 years of existence this center still flourishes!

We were asked by State of the Art to create three experiences. An interactive video wall, a corridor that could show Amoreiras Timeline while the visitors walk by and at last, the great attraction of the exhibition, an elevator interior that brings visitors to the last store, where they can have a full 360ยบ view of Lisbon. Amoreiras is known by the highest point in Lisbon.

In both the installations above, we faced many hostile light situations and because of these fact we needed to change the detection algorithm. More about this in the tech report.

This exhibition will be present until the end of October.
