On the 25th of March ArticaCC gave a workshop of our new tool Visualino at [INETE][1], one of our partners in our R&D project [USORA][2].

Visualino has been prototyped under [E-Duca][3] project, an R&D project to develop tools to enhance education co-financed by QREN. And it's now entering a new phase of development to try and turn it into a market-ready product. With this workshop at INETE, we obtained feedback from the teachers and students helping us develop a better tool.
