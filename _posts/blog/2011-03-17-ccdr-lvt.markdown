Today we're gonna enter in the time machine and show you our first work.

<a href="http://www.leonelmoura.com/">Leonel Moura</a>, robot artist, designed the "Stand Lisboa e Vale do Tejo" for the Feira de Portugal Tecnológico at FIL, and through <a href="http://www.idmind.pt/">IDMind</a> invited us to create interactive content to a huge led wall.

We were inspired by Leonel's painter robots and created a program with a computer vision detection system that analysis people movements and sends that information to a painting agent based particle system.

To do this, and due to the lack of time, we decided to do it with OpenFrameworks and invited <a href="http://s373.net/sier/">André Sier</a> to join us in this project.

André Sier is a great creative developer, with his knowledge in OpenFrameworks and agent based particle systems this work was a piece of cake, letting us in Artica improve our skills and deliver a high quality project with a great interaction.

Each particle have a live cycle, it appears near the people that are passing by, and is always trying to reach the people because they only survive if there is a person near by. When it moves, each particle leaves a colored trail creating a big abstract painting on the led wall, as you can see in the video above.
