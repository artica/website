Two artists had this great idea of a video projection inside a cylinder, with a 360º panoramic view of \"Praça de Touros de Montemor\" filled with persons, where each person represented a degree. Guess who they called to stich the 18 photos, and set all the projection system inside an empty cylinder... ? :)"

This was a huge challenge for us since we had never tried such a thing and a huge challenge for our Einstein VideoPlayer. Glad that we made it and everyone was happy!!
