Here's a new video from Magabot. This time we'll present you a demo compilation of all it's features.

Magabot is an open source and hardware robot so you have an almost unlimited world functions to do with it.

One of the biggest bets of this type of robots is education:

Nowadays, with the development of technology we can transform our day life in constant new experiences from earlier years. The lack of practical disciplines at school is one of the drop out's biggest factor.

In this new scenario robots like Magabot, also known as educational robots, can help not only students but also professors. Their implementationÂ  at schools allows everybody to have an easy access to robotics, coding or mechanics without the frightening conventions imposed by the society.

In Resume: it's a practical, fun and easy way to learn about electronics, programming languages and of course, robotics!
