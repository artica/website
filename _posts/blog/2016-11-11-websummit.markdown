We took some time off our extremely busy schedule to attend [Web Summit][1] in Lisbon this week. An extremely full venue booming with technology and venture capitalism.

We did the usual business networking with people, telling them about our [physical computing P2020][2] R&D project and what services we provide in the field of interactive installations, physical computing and educational robotics. It was a very enriching experience, we met a lot of interesting people and look forward to having it bare it's fruits in 2017.
