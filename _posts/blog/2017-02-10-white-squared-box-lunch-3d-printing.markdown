Our latest "white squared box lunch" session was about 3d printing technology. Guilherme Martins talked about 3d printing from the DIY and maker perspective, referencing [thingiverse][4], [makerbot][5], [beeverycreative][6], [cura][7] and [shapeways][8]. And our guest lecturer [Cristina Gaspar][1] shared with us a little about her experience with different printing techniques used on her research field of printed electronics.

We recorded a video of the presentations which is now available at youtube in Portuguese.
