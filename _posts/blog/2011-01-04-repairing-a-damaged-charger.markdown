We at <a href="http://www.artica.cc">Artica</a> are taking this manifesto very seriouslly:

<a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Manifesto">![](/assets/images/2011-01-04-repairing-a-damaged-charger-1.jpg)</a>

Due to a stupid mistake (inverted power wires), this battery charger (the best that my fingers ever touched) smoked for a second or two:

When we opened the case, there was this little SMD with a strange eruption result of an overburn, it was definetely what got burned, and it has written on it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/78xx">7805</a> (photo out of focus unfortunately)

This IC is very common in the electronics and robotics fields, it is a voltage regulator and in this case it regulates incoming voltage to 5 volts. We got a few 7805's laying around and decided to take a try repairing this because we need badly to charge Farrusco's batteries.

This is the result.

Not bad IMO! :)

A hole was opened to completely close the case, and it is now ready to roll, I mean charge again.
