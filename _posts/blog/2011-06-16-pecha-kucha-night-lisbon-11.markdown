The words <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/PechaKucha/158363636498?ref=ts&amp;sk=wall#!/pages/PECHA-KUCHA-NIGHT-LISBON/123376841018448">Pecha Kucha</a> mean the sound of the conversation, and this is the main priority of these events created in Japan to promote fresh and new ideas.

Pecha Kucha Night Lisbon, edition 11 took place at <a href="http://www.edp.pt/pt/sustentabilidade/fundacoes/fundacaoedp/museudaelectricidade/Pages/MuseuElectricidade.aspx">Museu da Electricidade</a> on June 3rd.

The environment was very casual and the participants have just 6.40' for each presentation so you don't have those endless monologues everybody hates so much. It's a bit like "show and tell" that we've experienced in the classroom as kids.

As you all know here at Artica we're always full of ideas so in the 11th edition<a href="http://www.edp.pt/pt/sustentabilidade/fundacoes/fundacaoedp/museudaelectricidade/Pages/MuseuElectricidade.aspx"></a> we had not one but two presentations! André Almeida introducing <a href="http://artica.cc/">Artica</a> and <a href="http://www.edp.pt/pt/sustentabilidade/fundacoes/fundacaoedp/museudaelectricidade/Pages/MuseuElectricidade.aspx">Guilherme Martins</a> with <a href="http://www.guibot.pt/">Motoruino and Farrusco</a>.

They've presented two videos with the route of both projects and the feedback couldn't be greater.
