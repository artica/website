We were present on this year's edition of Microsoft Pizza Night that took place on Microsoft's own headquarters in Lisbon. Our team presented a customized version of Artica's color voting system and Pong game that made such a buzz weeks ago on <a href="http://artica.cc/blog/2014/04/14/codebits.html">Sapo's Codebits 2014</a>.

The Pong game is an adaptation of the well known game. We already used it on <a href="http://artica.cc/blog/2014/04/14/codebits.html">Sapo's Codebits</a> and on <a href="http://artica.cc/blog/2013/09/26/audience-pong.html">Projecto 80</a> events, but this time we made some funny graphical changes. The game's paddles were made into rolling pins and the ball itself were transformed into a pizza that started to spin and move faster as the game was played. Crazy.

The color voting system was also customized for the event. The actual votes count was displayed as a... you guessed it, a pizza. The base pizza got filled with tasty ingredients in correlation with the actual positive votes from the crowd, so if a project didn't had any love from the crowd, a flavorless pizza started to appear instead.
Of course, we also had a numeric voting count that was shown, programmers like numbers after all.

We would like to thank all the Microsoft's team involved in this project for such a fun night.
A special thanks goes out to Miguel Vicente for organizing such a cool event and for the surprise candy!

Thank you!
