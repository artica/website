Since last month that Artica CC is now 5 years old!

It feels just like yesterday that in 2011 the dream of André and Guilherme to form their own company started taking form in [the garage of a big friend João Balão][1].

It's not easy running a business; we have to attend meetings, write proposals, deal with a crapload of bureaucracy and non-paying clients. But at the end of the day, it's all worth it when we get to do for a living the things that we love to do the most: Design; Prototype; Develop technology that gets used in real projects; Open source our software and hardware; Give workshops; Build robots; Write working code; Attend cool events; Host for visiting partners; Meet interesting people of all ages and nationalities.

We are proud of all the things we have achieved so far! We have built interactive museums, provided ground-breaking educational technology, researched for renowned international partners. We did a lot of projects in these 5 years.

And now we are no longer two friends in a small garage, our space increased considerably and our team has also grown. Now we are close to a dozen hardworking souls keeping the Artica Creative Computing dream alive. We have been recently evaluated as small-medium company with financial growth excellency. We are considered one of the most promising technology startups in Portugal.

Thank you to everyone who has helped us along the way but our work is not done yet. We aim to keep the core team small but look forward to keep building the best we can for our partners and clients. We hope to achieve our best activity year to date in 2016!
