Since last month that Artica CC is now 5 years old!

It feels like yesterday that the dream of Andr√© and Guilherme to form their own company started in 2011 in the garage of a friend.

It's not easy running a business, we had to attend meetings, write proposals, deal with a crapload of burocracy and non paying clients. But at the end of the day it's all worth it when we get to do for a living the things we love to do the most: Design. Prototype. Develop technology that gets used in real projects. Open source our software and hardware. Give workshops. Build robots. Write working code. Attend cool events. Host visiting partners. Meet interesting people of all ages and nationalities.

We are proud of all the things we have achieved so far! We have built interactive museums, provided ground-breaking educational technology, researched technology for reknown international partners. We did a lot.

And now we are no longer 2 friends in a small garage, our space increased and our team has grown. Now we are close to a dozen hardworking souls keeping the Artica Creative Computing dream alive. We have been recently evaluated as small medium company excellency growth. Considered one of the most promising technology startups in Portugal.

But our work is not done yet. We look forward to keep building the best we can possibly build for our partners and clients. Hope to achieve our best activity year to date in 2016!
