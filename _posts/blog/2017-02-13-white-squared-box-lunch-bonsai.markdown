Our latest "white squared box lunch" session was about the [Bonsai][1] framework. Ricardo Imperial gave a presentation on what it is, how we use it and how it's easily possible to develop our own nodes for it.

We recorded a video of the presentations which is now available at youtube in Portuguese. Sadly there was no desktop capture.
