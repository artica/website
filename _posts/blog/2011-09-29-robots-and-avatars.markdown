We made it!! ArticaCC and our wizkid <a href="http://www.franciscodias.net/">Francisco Dias a.k.a XicoMBD</a> applied for the contest <a href="http://www.robotsandavatars.net/">Robots and Avatars</a> and our project was one of the ten pre-selected!

"Robots and Avatars is an intercultural, intergenerational and interdisciplinary exploration of a near future world consisting of collaborations between robots, avatars, virtual worlds, telepresence and real time presence within creative places, work spaces, cultural environments, interactive entertainment and play space."

It's very important to us to continue developing our artistic side without limits, specially because Artica = Art + Informatics...!

<a href="http://www.robotsandavatars.net/events/call-for-proposals/pre-selected-projects/">COW</a> is the name of the project and we'll tell you more about it later....

The results will be announced Friday, 21st October. Now, fingers crossed to the only Portuguese team in the contest!
