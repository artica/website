This <a href="http://tedxedges.com/">TEDxEdges</a> was a huge event, and Artica marked its presence on stage with the Einstein VideoPlayer adapted to play the videos between the talks, and with a video mapping system to display the data captured by biometric <a href="http://www.plux.info/">PLUX</a> sensors on the TEDx letters on stage.

There were 4 gloves on the room, and each person wearing a glove would be able to send its emotions to the assigned 'TEDx' letter.

André and Guilherme went to stage to briefly present Artica's presence on the event, they mentioned the Farruscos playing sumo, the Magabot in telepresence mode being driven by <a href="http://www.franciscodias.net/">Francisco Dias</a> and finally what was behind the 'TEDx' letters.

[video soon]

In the foyer there were an arsenal of 5 Magabots all available to be remotelly controlled in Telepresence. This system is made with Skype and simple interface running on the robot side. So all you need is a Skype account and nothing more.
