During last month we had a series of workshops with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/josefgfcastro/">José Castro</a> which we would now like to share with the rest of the world. The goal of the workshops was getting his model of robotic survival behavior working with our <a href="http://magabot.cc">Magabot</a>. The resulting source-code is <a href="https://github.com/artica/MLM-Logic-Machine-Magabot">available online</a>. We also recorded some videos, they are in Portuguese though, so apologies about that to our foreigner site visitors.

We had a total of three sessions. The first was a powerpoint presentation explaining how his his robotic learning model works in theory.

The second work session was more hands-on, trying to get his python code that implemented his model working with one of our very own Magabot robots.

The last session was a wrap up and showcase session, explaining in detail the different source files of the project.
