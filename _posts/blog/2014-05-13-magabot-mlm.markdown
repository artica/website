During last month we had a series of workshops with [José Castro][1] which we would now like to share with the rest of the world. The goal of the workshops was getting his model of robotic survival behavior working with our [Magabot][2]. The resulting source-code is [available online][3] and so are the presentation slides [which were repurposed from SDIA2013][4].

We also recorded some videos, they are in Portuguese though, apologies to our non Portuguese speaking site visitors.

We had a total of three sessions. The first was a powerpoint presentation explaining how his robotic learning model works in theory.

The second work session was more hands-on, trying to get his python code that implemented his model working with one of our very own Magabot robots.

The last session was a wrap up and showcase session, explaining in detail the different source files of the project.
