Today we're gonna show you a little behind the scenes so you can see how all the work is done.

[Guilherme][1]'s working on [Farrusco][4]'s manual. He has to build one, step by step, photograph every item and all the steps so that anyone will be able to do it at home. After the 3rd time of repeating all the process he's getting a bit grumpy!

He's also working on the layout for [Farrusco][4]'s box, so take a sneak peek and tell us if you like it.
