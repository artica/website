A couple weeks ago we did lighting direction for a show of [Teatro ABC.PI][1], the show was based in the work of Blaise Cendrars called "Contos Negros para os filhos dos brancos". It was a 50 minutes show produced for kids, touching the subjects of identity, belonging and multiculturalism. It is a tale of 3 lost travellers surviving through imagination.
