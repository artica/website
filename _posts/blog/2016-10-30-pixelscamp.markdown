We took some time off our schedule to briefly drop by [Pixels Camp][1] that took place in Lisbon earlier this month.

It was a very interesting event, full of creative people and trendy technology.

We did a little networking, getting to know the latest trends and telling people about our client projects and [physical computing][2] research.
