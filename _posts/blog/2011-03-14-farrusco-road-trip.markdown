Now that you've met Farrusco, we can explain you some of the work we developed till we get the final version, available in <a href="http://www.guibot.pt/">guibot.pt</a>.

In one of it initial iterations, Farrusco had a camera on it and was controlled remotely via xbee. It was developed by Guilherme Martins in a project called <a href="http://lab.guilhermemartins.net/2010/04/11/swars/">SWARS (See What A Robot Sees)</a>.

Guilherme purposed to Nuno Morgadinho and Ana Aires (<a href="http://www.widgilabs.com/">widgilabs</a>) to develop a remote control via web application during the <a href="http://altlab.org/category/az_residency/">AZResidency</a>, an artistic residency promoted by Rui Horta that took place in the beautiful Convento da Saudação in Montemor-o-Novo.

Do you wanna see how it worked out? Did Farrusco missed home? Read all the report by Nuno Morgadinho <a href="http://www.morgadinho.org/2011/03/14/driving-farrusco/">here</a>.

Farrusco's coming back home soon and we hope that you will be able to gain control over him, remotely of course!
