We went to Barcelona on the 27th of August to give a [final pitch of our Fiware participation with Visualino][1].

Visualino was originally developed as part of project [E-Duca][6], an R&D project co-financed by QREN. With the end of E-Duca in 2015 we have now been trying to transform that initial prototype into a proper product able to reach the market.

Here is a demo video of how it's shaping up:

We already use Visualino internally for programming our robots and giving workshops, it's even already online, free to use, just go to [http://visualino.cc][3], but we don't consider it ready for public use just yet. We still need to clean up some bugs, integrate more key components, finish implementing a proper access portal for it, write the documentation and do some video tutorials. Lots of things until it's ready for the public.

With our participation in the [CreatiFi][4] program we pushed the development side using [Fiware][5] enablers to have access to cloud data storage and login components. We also benefited from help in prepare a more solid state of the art overview, business model, pricing models and investors pitch for the project. Helping us shape Visualino into a product almost ready to disrupt the market.

We are now looking for investment to help scale the project for large use. We already have a few ideas on how to monetize it in a sustainable environment, but the core usage will always be free, to incite people to use and share it. Above all we want to advance and disrupt the state of the art of the tools available to learn and create.

The presentation in Barcelona went well and the [prezi is available][2].
