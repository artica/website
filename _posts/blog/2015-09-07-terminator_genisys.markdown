As the main technology provider for our client [Audience Entertainment][1] in July we participated in Paramount's marketing campaign (with AMC and IMAX) for the release of Terminator: Genisys, the fifth movie of the franchise popularized by James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Our role was to give support to the installations occuring on the 5 theaters in the US and 1 cinema in Barcelona where the campaign of 3 minutes would play up to 5 times a day. We collaborated with AE defining the installation layout for the hardware installed on the theater (wifi router, access points, server, cables, switching system); integrated a communication solution with the IMAX cinema player system into our system; performed network reliability tests on the wifi solution; developed the user interface for the system; and the game playing on the screen in itself (based out of assets used in the mobile game developed by [Glu][9]).

When the IMAX system reaches the scheduled time it switches the projector input and sends our server an instruction to start playing the game. During the following 3 minutes the attending audience can interact with big screen in an engaging experience. Instructions are provided for the players to join the wireless hotspot. The players who join are divided into teams and forwarded to a local webpage where they can access a simple interface to join the game, fire at the terminators and get their team score feedback of the system. No application install is required to play the game. Winning team members get to collect prizes in the entrance lobby.
