Last week we relocated Artica to the city of Montemor-o-Velho and entered artistic residency mode. The objective was to stop working on what we usually work on and explore other things we also enjoy doing, whether they can be re-purposed for other work later on or not. The only prerogative was to showcase them at the end of the week to the rest of the team.

We had housing arrangements at Montemor-o-Velho and access to the theater where we setup shop with some tables and chairs, courtesy of [CITEC][5]. We had a great time there and would like to thank our hosts (family Galvão Mendes) and the people of Montemor-o-Velho for their hospitality.

We had a few minor preparation sessions before going, discussing possible things we could do, personal ideas, what things we should pack. During one of these sessions we came up with a theme, which was not mandatory but helped a few people to focus, it was the minotaur.

[Quoting wikipedia][1]: In Greek mythology, the Minotaur (/ˈmaɪnətɔː/, /ˈmɪnəˌtɔr/; Ancient Greek: Μῑνώταυρος [miːnɔ̌ːtau̯ros], Latin: Minotaurus, Etruscan Θevrumineś), was a creature with the head of a bull on the body of a man or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, "part man and part bull". He dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete.

Our operational headquarters in Montemor was the CITEC theater. We set up some workbench tables on stage for people to work on their projects.

Guilherme and André spent a few days improving Einstein[2], giving it a better stage light control interface. André had the idea of connecting it to a computer vision module (using an Axis camera, an infra-red light emitter and [Bonsai][3]) mapping the stage to a matrix of spotlights, triggered by the presence of a person in the cell. Xavier helped him a bit to get that working. So at the end of the week the stage lights could be switched to tracking mode, illuminating the areas of the stage where people are standing.

Ruben and André spent most of their first day doing deep research on new interaction paradigms with minimalistic interaction interfaces, systems that could be repurposed for audience interaction events in the form of ludic entertainment. They spent over 4 hours straight playing [Soccer Physics][4]. At the end of the week they wrote a key binder for Audience Entertainment Interactive System, enabling it to control the game directly through the motion of the attending audience during the projects showcase.

Tarquinio worked on two projects. The first was continued work on his interactive rollerblading cones, which get placed on the floor, containing an Arduino and can change colors depending on proximity sensors and sequences defined through a smart phone. The second project he was working on was a web interface for setting up images to be displayed on a rotating led strip system (as you sometimes see on bycicles for example).

Tarquinio also gave Artica a workshop on Visualino, as he had done at the MakerFaires in Lisbon and Rome. This allowed the rest of us from Artica who have not been working on Visualino to get better acquainted with the project, find bugs and point out improvement ideas.

Bruno Serras, Filipe Barbosa, Xavier, Coias and Ruben worked on a door tracking projection system to reveal a Minotaur. The project had multiple components, the main target was testing a magnetic sensor to measure the angle of a rotating door and use that value on projection mapping. Bruno handled the electronics, Coias handled the woodwork and painting, Xavier and Serras integrated the electronic outputs to Unity3D and Ruben integrated the projection mapping to the door using Unity3D. Filipe Barbosa moddeled the box and retouched a model of the minotaur he found online. The project also used a motoruino to wirelessly control the rotation of the minotaur's torso.

Our freelance friend Victor Martins of [Pixelnerve][6] joined us in the residency to work on a computer graphics demo with Jerome and Filipe. He has worked with Artica a few times before and it was great to have him drop by to share ideas.

Jerome and Filipe (Cruz, not Barbosa) spent their days composing new music and playing quake in local lan. Quake became an interactive installation where Artica collaborators could enter and be overwhelmed by Filipe, in a literal representation of the minotaur in the labyrinth, hunting down the visitors and delivering them a gruesome death. At the end of the week Jerome and Filipe played an improvised live act with the material they had composed during the week, featuring Coias playing an amplified barrel bass. Filipe Barbosa and Guilherme helped with projected visuals and stage lights responding to sound.

Inácio took the opportunity to get back to programming, developing in processing a proof of concept multi-screen content player prototype with its own product strategy.

Filipe Barbosa did some 360 video recording experiments with Xavier and fiddled with them using Cinema 4D, adding virtual 3D elements to video with motion tracking.

We also took the opportunity to do a little team building and internal workshops sessions, to help us think together what we want for the future of Artica.

Artica was created by people who were tired of working the wrong way. Who believed what they enjoyed doing had a market and was worth pursuing. In these 4 years Artica has grown from 2 people in a garage to 12 people occupying the right wing of a building. We must be doing something right. But it's always worth reflecting on where we have been, where we are now and what we still want to achieve.
