Light Design is now easier with Artica's DMX controller.

![](/assets/images/2015-01-26-dmx_image.jpg)

The main purpose of this app is to simplify the light design process and to connect all kinds of sensors to a DMX controlled light set. More about this in the near future.

Meanwhile, you can download the app or if you are brave enough to mess with [MAX][1], the source code is available at our [Github][2] page. Instructions are available and in case you find it difficult to deal with, just drop us an email.

For the DMX interface we are using an [ENTTEC DMXUSBPRO][3].
