Light Design is now easier with Artica's DMX controller.

![](/assets/images/2015-01-26-dmx_image.jpg)

The main purpose of this app is to simplify the light design process and to connect all kind of sensors to a DMX controlled Light Set. More about this in the near future.

In the meanwhile you can download the app or if you are brave enough to mess with [MAX][1] code the source is also available at our [Github page][2], instructions available, and in case you find it difficult to deal with, just drop us an email.

For the DMX interface we are using an [ENTTEC DMXUSBPRO][3]
