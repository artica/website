Last September we were envolved in the production of the exhibition “Desumano" (unhuman), in a partnership with Mapa das Ideias.

The exhibition went so well that the client decided to make it itinerant.

Beside the production we developed interactive telephones and radios that played ambient soundscapes for the segment “Ousar Escutar” (dare to listen).

Each telephone had to be autonomous, so we used an <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> and a Wave  Shield from <a href="http://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>. These shields are very easy and straighforward to  use, and in a couple of minutes we had all the system coded and ready to  be assembled.

When the phone is picked up, one can hear in the first person, different testimonials of those who experienced it. All the electronics were hidden inside the phones and the radios.

The radios played different news reports about human traffic, and both were using another Arduino with a Wave Shield. All sounds were recorded and edited by Paulo Machado.

Our good friends from <a href="http://demo93.com">Demo 93</a>, created this amazing sculpture called SINA.
