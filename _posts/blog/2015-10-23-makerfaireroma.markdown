We attended [Maker Faire Rome 2015][1] to take a good look at the trends booming in the makers scene and present our new projects [Gyro][2] and [Visualino][3] (now named Gyro Creator). We had a stand which was constantly filled with curious people wanting to play and learn more about our robot and tools. We also held a workshop on how to work with visualino. Here are some photos we took of our presence at the event:
