On the 8th of April, the FCT university opened its doors in [an open day][1] to college students to see what the university has to offer.

ArticaCC was invited to give a few workshops with some of our technologies. A perfect opportunity to test drive our beta development on the Visualino framework we have been developing as part of [E-Duca][2] project. We gave a crash-course and managed to get some kids programming some of our robots. Then they did something similar with Lego NXT models. So we now have some comparative data on how our platform compares to others in the market.

We had students from all sorts of colleges: Dr. José Afonso, D. João II, Externato Penafirme, EBS Pedro Fonseca, Mem Martins, Externato de S. José, Sá da Bandeira, Carcavelos, Agrupamento Escolas Caparica, Escola Francisco Rodrigues Lobo, D. Pedro V.
