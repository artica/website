We're very glad to announce that ARTICA is at the third day of <a href="https://codebits.eu/">Sapo Code Bits V</a> alive and kicking!

We developed a Codebits robot replica, a gift from <a href="http://hipnose.com/">Hipnose</a> to Sapo, with <a href="www.magabot.cc">Magabot</a> as base. The mascot has the same caracteristics as<a href="https://codebits.eu/s/blog/1858ebaa99b14d0355dad96dbf1bf0b4"> Magabot</a>, you can control it with telepresence with just a Skype account!

Wanna try and get a ride? Add Magabot.cc on skype and have an unique experience at Sapo Code Bits V!

With Microsoft we tried to control the robot with KINECT software and it was a huge success!
