It's no secret where our heart belongs when it comes to robotic/hardware platforms. Obviously, we wouldn't miss an opportunity to show our latest creations based on the Arduino tech. After all, that's the purpose of these gatherings around the world, isn't it? The pictures speak for themselves! If you missed it, well, shame on you! Our Arduino based robots rocked!

Next time you'd better give it a try. You won't be sorry for your time!
